# COMMIT_CITIES

In a place where the code of the world is stored and shared,
every commit to a public repository leaves a trace.

From a developer's public contributions, a generative city
emergesâ€”a vibrant tapestry of collaboration and creation.
COMMIT_CITIES artistically represents what developers leave
behind as an explorable 3D cityscape. Discover how each building
is uniquely generated from a real GitHub commit.
